The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate python, visualization and by augmentation, analytical skills. This project is taken from Absent Data Hospital Wait Times beginner's project using Excel. The original video can be found at [YouTube Absent Data Analysis Hospital Wait Times](https://youtu.be/34cvSgkuaqc).

The data is hospital data and management is interested in resolving complaints on wait times. The Absent Data data analyst produces four visualizations to gain insight into the hospital wait times and includes these in the final presentation of a data story instead of a single dashboard. The visualizations in data order-story are:
- Count of Patients by Financial Class
- Count of Patients by Day of Week 
- Average Wait Time by Hours of Day and Day of Week
- Average Wait Time and Count of Patients By Day of Week




-----
1. Reformat date field to short date in Excel
2. Compute wait time as completion time - entry time,  formatted as a houms:minutes, and the minutes per day; minutes per day is 1440 minutes per day multiplied by wait time
3. Obtain textual day of week from the date
4. Get the hour of entry
